# Are open-air festivals related to temperature in Europe?

When warmer temperatures and longer days arrive, one of the highlights of this season start to appear: Festivals! Who does not have really good stories in festivals during the warmer months of the year? But, are the number of festivals in Europe somehow related to temperature? In this analysis we will try to find out if there's any correlation between monthly temperatures in cities spread over Europe and the number of festivals they held. For that reason, we will first cluster the list of cities by temperature and check the average number of festivals per cluster. 

Are you thinking about creating a new open-air festival? This analysis might help you decide.
