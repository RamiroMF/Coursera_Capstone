# Are open-air festivals related to temperature in Europe?

We have been contacted by an investor wanting to create a new open air festival in Europe. Among other aspects, the client wants to see if there is any correlation between the number of existing festivals and some weather conditions, specifically temperature. For this reason, we will conduct a clustering analysis of a list of different cities in Europe and its monthly temperatures, along with the number of festivals in each city extracted from Foursquare.
